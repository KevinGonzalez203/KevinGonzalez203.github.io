### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was one of my favorites because I found it fun to take real-world scenarios, such as parking rules, and incorporate them into coding a program that checks whether parking is allowed during certain times or hours. I learned how to check if the user inputs the correct amount of arguments.

* Lab 1

    I chose to include Lab 1 as one of my favorites because it was one of the first labs to introduce me to the basics of coding. I learned fundamentals such as how to push code and how to access files. This lab serves as a reminder of where I started in my coding journey.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 Part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because I got to learn a new card game and turn it into a program that lets you play and calculate your score. This lab was challenging because we had to code not only the card names but also the numbers for each suit. Overall, it was rewarding to see the game come to life through coding.
